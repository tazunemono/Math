# a cheap and sleazy rational approximation of pi (or any other irrational number)

# let's import the math library and use its value of Pi (or math.e)
import math as m

# this is my function to return two integers which approximate an irrational
def foolconstant():
    # n is the number of times to iterate. Larger numbers yield a better approximation.
    n = 1000000
    # mconst is the constant you with to approximate (pi or e)
    myconst = m.pi
    # temp list stores the results modulo 1
    temp = list()
    # temp2 list stores the results
    temp2 = list()
    for i in range(1, n):
        # taking an irrational times itself a number of times generates a range of decimal values modulo 1. 
        # the largest decimal value modulo 1 is the best representation of a rational demoninator. 
        temp.append(i * myconst % 1)
        temp2.append(i * myconst)
    # once we cycle thru, let's fond the largest decimal (modulo 1)
    result = max((k, j) for j, k in enumerate(temp))
    #return the "rounded up" value, the indexed position (+ 1 since zero-indexed), and the original constant
    return m.ceil((temp2[(result[1])])), result[1]+1, myconst

answer = foolconstant()
print ("The number", answer[0], "divided by", answer[1], "will approximate the input constant to", answer[2] / (answer[0] / answer[1]) * 100, "percent")

# it isn't pretty but it works!
